## Changes

Well look at us, we're on GitHub now! Probably. It'll PROBABLY work.

Since the last posting, I've firstly exported all Pokemon and blank trainers into packs to HEAVILY boost load times, only loading in actors you need!

Materially, I've also implemented a 'resistances' tab on characters that holds how they're affected by each type.

Furthermore, I've added the icons for medicines, Pokeballs, and held items onto Trainer character sheets, and icons for held items to Pokemon.

I've also updated the battle script to check these resistances as well as provide feedback as to who is affected.
